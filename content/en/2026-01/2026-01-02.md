### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **Nerd: A Programming Language for Machines.**
    Nerd is a [new programming language (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46450217) nobody is supposed to look at. It's designed specifically for AI models, not humans. The author claims machine-generated code makes up nearly half of all code, sparking fierce debates about debugging and auditing. Is this the future, or just a [wrong path (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46450217)? 🤔

2.  **SpaceTimePilot: A Major Breakthrough in Video Generation.**
    Video generation just hit a massive milestone! The new [SpaceTimePilot model (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25075) has achieved spatiotemporal decoupling, meaning you can now freely change the viewpoint even in monocular videos. Dynamic scene generation? No problem anymore! The training uses a smart approach, leveraging [multi-view data (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25075) to make it happen. ✨

3.  **HEAR: Quantifying Musical Aesthetics.**
    Can musical aesthetics really be quantified by AI? Well, the [HEAR framework (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18869) is taking on that challenge! It combines multi-scale feature extraction to capture melodic beauty and uses a hierarchical enhancement strategy to prevent overfitting. Plus, it's crushing it on the [SongEval benchmark (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18869). Pretty cool, right? 🎵

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Tesla FSD Crosses the US with Zero Interventions.**
    Elon Musk's decade-old boast is finally real! Tesla FSD just pulled off an epic feat, [crossing America (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652659659&idx=1&sn=48c41752c3ed20726ed288da90dbd10a) with absolutely zero human interventions over nearly 4,400 kilometers. This is a total win for end-to-end neural networks. Could the steering wheel really be headed for the [history books (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652659659&idx=1&sn=48c41752c3ed20726ed288da90dbd10a)?
