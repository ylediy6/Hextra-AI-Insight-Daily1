### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **OpenAI's latest models are spilling the tea!** ☕ Notion accidentally leaked secret internal codenames like [Olive Oil Cake (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-12-10-13), rumored to be the real deal GPT-5.2. Plus, two next-gen image models, [Chestnut and Hazelnut (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-12-10-13), have also surfaced, promising to ditch those pesky warm filters and crank up the detail. 👀 The buzz is they might drop on December 11th, possibly to throw a wrench in 🔥 Google Gemini 3's plans.

2.  **Microsoft Excel's web version is now rocking an AI Agent Mode!** 🤖 Business users with Microsoft 365 can dive into this new feature, which lets you use natural language to run "what-if" analyses and build budget models. Super cool for finance pros, the AI's reasoning is totally transparent. Transparency FTW! ✨ It’s hitting desktop in January, and personal users will get access too. Get ready to level up your spreadsheets!

3.  **Musk's xAI just dropped its Halftime tool, and it's wild!** 🤯 This new tech can inject [Real-time Brand Ad Placements (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23554) directly into movies, like a character suddenly sipping a 🥤Coca-Cola in "Hero." Viewers can hit a "learn more" button to jump to a product page, and poof! The ad disappears after they're done. While super innovative, this tech, developed by University of Waterloo students, is already stirring up copyright controversy. 😬

4.  **Doubao Mobile Assistant's tech secrets are out!** 🕵️‍♀️ A large model intern dropped a [Thousands of Words Hands-on Review (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652652955&idx=1&sn=3120e6f59c621dea8a2b88139de00c7a) on Xiaohongshu, dissecting Doubao's hybrid perception routing and OS-level virtualization. Standard mode boasts response times under 500ms ⚡, while Pro mode even has self-reflection capabilities. The review confirmed that the system guarantees privacy through task-level physical isolation – no physical screen streams are read. Phew! 🔒<br/>![AI News: Doubao Mobile Assistant Operation Flowchart](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kc4damfqfk0rfs93jec5m0qs.avif)<br/>

### Frontier Research

1.  **Qwen-Image-i2L is here to blow your mind!** 🎨 The DiffSynth-Studio team just dropped [Qwen-Image-i2L (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/a066c3/qwen-image-i2L-lora), a model that generates stylized LoRA files from just a single image. No joke! It comes in four versions: Precise, Stylish, Realism, and Balanced. This bad boy is open source (MIT + Apache-2.0), supports offline operation ⚡, and can be directly integrated into models like Stable Diffusion. Talk about convenience! 🤯<br/>![AI News: Qwen-Image-i2L Style Transfer Effects](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kc4daz6he2xvnk52m4ya8t8m.avif)<br/>

2.  **Embodied Tree of Thoughts (EToT) is shaking things up in AI!** 🌳 The paper [Embodied Tree of Thoughts (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08188) introduces the EToT framework, modeling operational planning as a tree search ⚡. This system generates candidate paths via a prior branch, while a reflection branch uses VLM to diagnose and correct failures. A physical simulator acts as an embodied world model 🚀, ensuring plans adhere to rigid body dynamics and collision constraints. So smart! ✨ EToT significantly outperforms baseline methods in long-term tasks.

3.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL) is diving deep into the role of feedback in skill acquisition!** 🧠 A new study, [Exploring Feedback Mechanisms Using Reinforcement Learning (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08463), uses RL agents to control the drag of a rotating cylinder in a water tank 🌊. The experiments revealed that high-dimensional flow field feedback quickly uncovers high-performing strategies ⚡, but surprisingly, performance holds up even without feedback during action sequence replay. While training without feedback failed for drag maximization, it *succeeded* for drag minimization. Wild! 🤯 This really shows how complex learning conditions can be.

4.  **EvoScene is making waves by generating full 3D scenes from a single image!** 🖼️ The paper [EvoScene (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08905) introduces a training-free framework that iteratively reconstructs 🎨 3D scenes in three stages. The system smartly combines the geometric reasoning of 3D generative models with the visual knowledge of video generative models, gradually refining structure and appearance 🚀. Tests show EvoScene crushes baselines in geometric stability and view-consistent textures, generating ready-to-use 3D meshes. Sweet! ✨

5.  **Aerial VLN is here to streamline drone navigation!** 🚁 The paper [Aerial VLN (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08639) introduces a unified framework for drones that only needs egocentric monocular RGB and natural language instructions. How cool is that? 😎 The model uses prompt-guided multi-task learning ⚡ to jointly optimize spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction. Plus, a clever keyframe selection strategy cuts down on visual redundancy, and an action merging mechanism tackles long-tail supervision imbalance. It totally crushes RGB-only baselines in benchmark tests. 🚀

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **The EU is officially digging into Google's AI Overviews!** 🕵️‍♀️ The European Commission has launched an investigation to see if [Google AI Overview Feature (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23551) is using website content without permission. The probe is focusing on answers generated from YouTube videos and compensation for online publishers ⚡. The EU is accusing Google of using its traffic control to push unfair terms and restrict competitors from training AI models. Ouch! 😬 Google, meanwhile, is pushing back, saying this could stifle innovation. Let the legal drama begin! 🎬

2.  **The 2026 Spring Festival Gala is sparking a wild sponsorship war!** 🤖 Insiders are saying the Year of the Horse Gala has become a hot battleground for [Embodied AI Companies Competing (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23559). Sources reveal that Zhiyuan Robot bid 60 million yuan, but Unitree Robotics immediately upped the ante to 100 million yuan 🔥! Zhiyuan claims it's "not true," but industry folks confirm multiple companies are still duking it out ⚡. The final sponsor will need to balance brand image and development factors. Talk about fierce competition! 💸

3.  **Addy Osmani's "Beyond Vibe Coding" guide is here to set the record straight!** 📝 The Google Engineering Lead just dropped a [New Book (AI News)](https://beyond.addy.ie/) that criticizes "Vibe Coding" 🚀 for only getting 70% of the job done, leaving the crucial 30% to solid engineering chops. His core philosophy? Plan before you code, use context engineering instead of just prompt engineering ⚡, and embrace CLI agents and multi-agent orchestration. Developers of the future need to shift from coders to decision-makers, focusing on precisely defining intent. It’s all about working smarter, not just harder! 💡<br/>![AI News: AI-Assisted Development Engineering Framework Diagram](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kc4dn1v4e5nrctzjcv3sp8wr.avif)<br/>

4.  **Xiaomi is making big moves into the K12 market with AI education!** 🎓 The Xiaomi Group just posted a bunch of [AI Education Positions (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23545), including Product Manager (26K-50K) and Business Manager roles. These positions are all about their "human-car-home" ecosystem, aiming to offer personalized learning experiences on phones, tablets, and other devices.
