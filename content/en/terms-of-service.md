# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll call it 'the Site' or 'us' from now on). **These Terms of Service** are super important, so please give them a good read before you start using our stuff. By simply checking out or using the Site, you're automatically giving your thumbs-up and agreeing to everything written here!

## 1. What We Offer
**What we offer** includes awesome paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. Think blog posts, special resources, e-books, and even cool community hangouts! Some of the really good stuff is just for our subscribers, though. 😉

## 2. Your Account & Registration
- To get started, **users** need to give us a valid email address and pick a password to set up an account.
- **Your account**'s security and everything that happens with it is totally on you! Seriously, no passing it around or sharing it – that's a **big no-no**.
- **We** totally have the right to **hit pause or even close down** your account if you mess up and break these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscriptions
- **Our subscriptions** are billed either monthly or yearly, and you'll see all the costs super clearly on the checkout page. No hidden fees, promise! ✨
- **All payments** go through trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe or PayPal). Don't worry, **we** never stash your payment deets ourselves. Your info is safe! 🔒
- Heads up: **Subscriptions** will **auto-renew**! So, if you don't want the next billing cycle, make sure to cancel before your current one ends.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty cool: if you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of buying. Just hit us up via the contact email at the very end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund, though! After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, sorry, **no refunds** after payment unless the law *really* says we have to. 🤷‍♀️

## 4. Content Use & IP Stuff
- **All original content** here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial gain without our say-so. Play fair! 😇
- **Users** get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access pass** to our stuff, strictly for personal learning and reading. Keep it personal! 📚
- **If you need it for business** or want to quote a lot, just ping us to get the green light. 👍

## 5. User Conduct – Don't Be That Guy!
- **You absolutely can't** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on someone else's toes. Seriously, let's keep it chill. 🚫
- **It's a big no-no** to try and bulk download, scrape, or hack into our member-exclusive content using technical tricks. We'll notice! 🙅‍♂️
- **We** totally have the right to zap any inappropriate content and **boot users** who break the rules. Fair warning! 🚀

## 6. Services Changing & Glitches
- **We** might change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how things roll sometimes. 🎢
- **We're not on the hook for any compensation** if our content temporarily goes offline because of crazy stuff like acts of nature, server meltdowns, or third-party service hiccups. Bummer, but out of our hands! 😅

## 7. Disclaimer – Read This!
- **The info we share** here is just for kicks and general knowledge; it's **not** meant to be any kind of professional advice (like for your money, legal stuff, or health). Always check with the pros for that! 🧑‍💼👩‍⚖️👨‍⚕️
- **We** are **not responsible** for any direct or indirect oopsies or losses you might run into from using our content or services. Just keeping it real! 😬

## 8. The Legal Stuff
- **These Terms** are all about California, USA law, and that's how we'll interpret them, no fuss about conflicting legal principles. West Coast vibes! 🌴
- **Any spats** that pop up because of or related to these terms? Let's try to chat it out first, nice and friendly. If we can't sort it, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Game on! ⚖️
