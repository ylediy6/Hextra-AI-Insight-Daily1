# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we")! Before you dive into using our services, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By simply accessing or using our site, you're signaling your agreement and acceptance of these terms. 👍

## 1. What We Offer ✨
**Our services** are all about hooking you up with paid subscription content and awesome member services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, cool e-books, and even community vibes! Just a heads-up, some of our juiciest content is exclusively for our subscribed members.

## 2. Your Account & Registration 🔒
**When it comes to your account,** you'll need to sign up with a valid email and pick a password. Remember, your account is your baby – you're totally responsible for its security and everything that happens on it. And hey, **no transferring or sharing** your account, please! If you go against these terms, we've got the right to **pause or even close down** your account.

## 3. Paid Subscription Perks 💳
**Our paid subscription services** kick off with either monthly or yearly billing cycles, and you'll see all the costs super clearly on the checkout page. Don't sweat your payment info – all transactions go through trusty third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. We never stash your details! Your subscription will **auto-renew** to keep the good times rolling, unless you decide to cancel before your current billing period ends. Now, for the cool part: our **14-Day Refund Policy**! If you're a first-time subscriber and aren't totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email at the bottom of these terms and tell us what went wrong. Heads up: it's one refund per user. Past 14 days or for repeat subscribers, generally, **no refunds** after payment, unless the law says otherwise.

## 4. Our Content & Your Rights ©
**When it comes to our content and your intellectual property rights,** here's the deal: all the original goodies you find here are **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reprinting, or using them for commercial purposes without our explicit permission. You're getting a **non-exclusive, non-transferable pass** to access it for your personal learning and reading enjoyment. If you're eyeing it for commercial use or want to quote a bunch, just shoot us a message to get authorization.

## 5. Play Nice: User Conduct Rules ⚠️
**Regarding user conduct rules,** let's keep it clean! It's a big **NO-NO** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Also, absolutely **no trying to bulk download, scrape, or hack** our member content using technical tricks. We've got the power to yank any inappropriate content and **boot any rule-breaking users** off the platform.

## 6. Heads Up: Service Changes & Downtime 🛠️
**About service changes and potential interruptions,** we reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even completely stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. And if, by some chance, content becomes temporarily unreachable because of stuff like natural disasters, server hiccups, or third-party service outages, then we're **not on the hook for any compensation**.

## 7. Our Disclaimer: Read This! ❗
**Regarding our disclaimer,** just a friendly reminder: all the info we dish out on this site is purely for your reference and **shouldn't be taken as any professional advice** (we're talking financial, legal, medical – you name it!). Also, **we're totally not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might run into from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. The Legal Stuff: Governing Law ⚖️
**When it comes to governing law,** these Terms of Service are totally dictated by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA, no matter what other legal principles might try to butt in. If any beef pops up from or related to these terms, we both agree to try and hash it out with some friendly chats first. If talking it out doesn't work, then you agree to take things to the competent courts in Santa Clara County, California.
