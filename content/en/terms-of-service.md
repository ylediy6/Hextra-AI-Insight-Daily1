# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "**the Site**" or "**we**"). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're pretty much saying 'Yep, I agree!' to these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
The Site provides users with paid subscription content and membership services, like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction, among other cool stuff. Just a heads-up, some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration and Account
*   Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
*   Users are responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing your account!**
*   The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed monthly/annually, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
*   All payments are processed via third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, we don't store your payment info.
*   Subscriptions will **auto-renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked about our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why. Each user gets one refund opportunity. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are **non-refundable** unless mandated by law.

## 4. Content Usage and Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without authorization.
*   Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** the content for personal learning and reading. It's just for you!
*   If you need it for commercial use or extensive quoting, just reach out to the Site for permission.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Users are **prohibited** from uploading, posting, or distributing any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights.
*   Users are also **forbidden** from using technical means to bulk download, scrape, or crack member content. Seriously, don't do it.
*   The Site reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**.

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate all or part of our services at any time, without prior notice. Keep an eye out!
*   The Site **will not be liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Stuff happens.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical advice). Don't take it as gospel!
*   The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using our content or services. Just sayin'.

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Standard stuff.
*   For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties should first try to resolve them amicably. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's keep it friendly first, though!
