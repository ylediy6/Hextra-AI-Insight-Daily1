# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and disclose your information when you use our Service. It also informs you about your privacy rights and the legal protections in place for you. ✨

We use your personal data to make our Service awesome and keep it running smoothly. By jumping into our Service, you're giving us the green light to collect and use your info as explained in this Privacy Policy. 😉

## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation
Heads up! 🚨 Words capitalized in this document have specific meanings, defined right below. These definitions stick, whether they're singular or plural.

### Definitions
Here's what these terms mean for this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** means that special spot we set up for you to get into our Service, or parts of it.

- **Affiliate** is basically any company that's in the same family as us – it controls, is controlled by, or shares common control with us. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the voting shares or other securities. Think of it as our corporate cousins! 🤝

- **Company** (that's "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this policy) is none other than **hubtoday**!

- **Cookies**? They're just tiny files websites stash on your computer, phone, or any other device. They remember stuff like your browsing history on that site, among other cool tricks! 🍪

- **Country** means: California, USA! 🇺🇸

- **Device** is any gadget you use to tap into our Service, like your computer, phone, or tablet. 💻📱

- **Personal Data** is any info that can be linked back to you – a specific, identifiable person. That's pretty straightforward, right?

- **Service**? That's just our Website!

- **Service Provider** means a person or company helping us out, processing data on our behalf. These are the awesome third-party folks or individuals we hire to keep the Service running smoothly, offer support, or help us understand how you're using it. They're like our behind-the-scenes heroes! 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️

- **Usage Data** is the info we automatically collect about how you use our Service, or from the Service's infrastructure itself (think page visit times, for example).

- **Website** means **hubtoday**, which you can find right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/` 😉

- **You** refers to you, the person using or accessing our Service, or the company or legal entity you're representing. Basically, it's about *you*! ✨

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask for some personal details that can help us get in touch or figure out who you are. This "personally identifiable information" could include (but isn't limited to):

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That's collected automatically when you're rocking our Service. 🤘

Your Usage Data might include cool stuff like your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), what kind of browser you're using (and its version!), which pages you visit on our Service, when you visit, how long you hang out on those pages, unique device IDs, and other diagnostic bits. Pretty neat, huh?

If you're accessing our Service on your mobile device, we might automatically grab some extra info. This includes (but isn't limited to) your mobile device type, its unique ID, IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. 📲

Also, your browser sends us some info every time you visit our Service – whether it's from your computer or your mobile device. We collect that too! 🤓

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We use Cookies and other neat tracking tech to keep an eye on what's happening on our Service and store some info. These tracking tools, like beacons, tags, and scripts, help us gather and follow data to make our Service even better and understand how it's used. Here’s a peek at what we might use: 👇

- **Cookies (or Browser Cookies, if you want to be fancy)**: Picture a Cookie as a tiny file chilling on your Device. You're in charge – tell your browser to say "nope" to all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's coming. Just a heads-up: if you don't play nice with Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. Unless you've told your browser otherwise, our Service will likely be using Cookies! 🍪
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear them called clear GIFs, pixel tags, or single-pixel GIFs). These help us do things like count how many folks have visited a page or opened an email, plus other cool website stats – like seeing which parts are popular or just checking if our systems are running smoothly. 👀

So, Cookies come in two main flavors: "Persistent" or "Session." Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even after you've gone offline. Session Cookies? Poof! ✨ They vanish as soon as you close your browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for a few key reasons, which we'll spell out right now: 👇

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies** (the must-haves!)
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Who manages them**: Us, of course!
  - **Why we use 'em**: These are super important for making sure you can actually *use* our Website and its features. They help us confirm who you are and keep those pesky fraudsters away from your Account. No essential Cookies? No service! We only use these to get you what you need. 👍

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies** (the "you said yes" ones!)
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Who manages them**: Still us!
  - **Why we use 'em**: These just remember if you've already given us the thumbs-up to use Cookies on our Website. No need to ask you every time! 😉

- **Functionality Cookies** (the memory keepers!)
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Who manages them**: Us!
  - **Why we use 'em**: These are super helpful because they remember your choices when you're using our Website – think login info or your fave language. They're all about giving you a smoother, more personal experience so you don't have to re-enter stuff constantly. Pretty sweet, right? ✨

### Use of Your Personal Data
The Company might use your Personal Data for these cool reasons: 👇

- **To get our Service up and running (and keep it that way!)**, this includes keeping an eye on how it's being used.
- **To manage your Account**: We use your data to handle your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you share lets you tap into all the awesome features available to registered users! 🎉
- **To keep our promises (contractually speaking!)**: This means handling the purchase contract for anything you buy from us, or any other agreement you make with us through the Service. We're all about sticking to our word! ✅
- **To get in touch with you**: We might reach out via email, phone, text, or even app notifications for updates or important info about features, products, or services you've signed up for – including security updates! We'll only do it when it's truly necessary or makes sense. 📞📧
- **To send you cool stuff**: Think news, special offers, and general info about other products, services, and events that might be up your alley (similar to what you've already checked out or bought). Of course, you can always say "no thanks" to these! 😉
- **To handle your requests**: We'll take care of any questions or requests you send our way. We're here to help! 👋
- **For company shake-ups (business transfers)**: If we ever get involved in a merger, sale, restructuring, or anything like that, we might use your info to assess or go through with the deal. This includes situations where your Personal Data (as one of our Service users) is part of the assets being transferred. It's just part of doing business! 💼
- **For other cool stuff**: We might also use your info for things like crunching data, spotting trends in how you use our Service, seeing if our promos actually work, and generally making our Service, products, marketing, and *your* experience even better! We're always aiming to improve! 🚀

Here's when we might share your personal info: 👇

- **With our Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our awesome Service Providers. They help us monitor and analyze how our Service is doing, and sometimes they help us get in touch with you. Teamwork makes the dream work! ✨
- **For company shake-ups (business transfers)**: Just like before, if we're ever in talks about a merger, selling off assets, financing, or another company buying us out, your personal info might be shared or transferred as part of that process. It's standard procedure! 🤝
- **With our Affiliates**: We might share your info with our affiliated companies. Don't worry, we'll make sure they play by the same privacy rules! Our affiliates include our parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture pals, and any other companies we control or share control with. Family business, you know? 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- **With our Business Partners**: We team up with business partners to bring you cool products, services, or promos, and sometimes we share your info with them to make that happen. Win-win! 🎉
- **With other users (when you choose to!)**: If you share personal info or interact in public areas of our Service, just remember that everyone else might see it – and it could even be shared publicly outside the Service. So, share wisely! 😉
- **With your "okay"**: We might spill your personal info for any other reason, but *only* if you give us the green light first! 👍

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company only keeps your Personal Data for as long as we *really* need it to do what's outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your data as much as needed to stick to our legal duties (like when laws say we have to keep it!), sort out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed. It's all by the book! 📚

The Company also keeps Usage Data for our internal analysis (nerdy stuff, but important!). Generally, Usage Data sticks around for a shorter time. The exceptions? When it helps boost our Service's security, makes things work better, or if the law says we *have* to keep it longer. Security first! 🔒

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Heads up! Your info (including your Personal Data!) gets processed at the Company's main offices and wherever our processing partners are. This means your data might be zipping over to and stored on computers located outside of your state, province, or even country. Keep in mind, data protection laws in those places might be different from where you are! 🌍

By giving us your "okay" to this Privacy Policy and submitting your info, you're essentially agreeing to this data transfer. Just wanted to be super clear! 👍

The Company promises to take every reasonable step to keep your data safe and sound, totally in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't send your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're *absolutely sure* they've got solid security controls in place for your info. Your data's safety is our priority! 🔒

### Delete Your Personal Data
You've got the power! 💪 You can delete or ask us to help you delete the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info right there from inside the platform. How convenient! ✨

You can update, change, or delete your info anytime! Just log into your Account (if you have one) and head to the account settings where you can manage your personal details. Or, if you prefer, just hit us up directly to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any personal info you've given us. Easy peasy! 👍

Just a quick heads-up: sometimes we might need to hang onto certain info if we have a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to do so. It's not personal, it's just legal! ⚖️

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might be part of that transfer. But don't worry, we'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy. Transparency is key! 🔑

#### Law enforcement
Sometimes, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) come knocking with a valid request. We gotta play by the rules! 👮‍♀️

#### Other legal requirements
The Company might also disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to: 👇

- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
Look, the security of your Personal Data is a BIG deal to us! 💖 But let's be real: no method of sending data over the internet or storing it electronically is ever *100%* foolproof. While we bust our butts using commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't promise it'll be absolutely, perfectly secure every single time. We do our best, though! 💪

## Children's Privacy (Super Important!) 👶
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13. Period. We absolutely *do not* knowingly collect personal info from kids under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you find out your little one has given us Personal Data, please, *please* get in touch with us. If we discover we've snagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll quickly wipe that info from our servers. Promise! 🛑

If we ever need your consent to process your info (and your country says parents need to sign off), we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that data. Gotta follow the rules! 👨‍👩‍👧

## Links to Other Websites (Surf Safely! 🏄‍♀️)
Our Service might have links to other websites that we *don't* run. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to their site. We seriously recommend you take a peek at the Privacy Policy of *every* site you visit. Better safe than sorry!

Just so you know, we don't have any control over (and can't take responsibility for) what's on those third-party sites or services, or their privacy policies and practices. It's on them!

## Changes to This Privacy Policy (Heads up! 🔔)
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. If we do, we'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the fresh new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before any changes actually kick in, we'll give you a heads-up either by email or with a big notice on our Service. We'll also update that "Last updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy. No surprises! 🥳

We totally recommend you check this Privacy Policy regularly to catch any changes. Any updates to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment we post them right here on this page. Stay informed! 🤓
